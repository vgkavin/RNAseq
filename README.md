This pipeline utilizes the Snakemake workflow management system to preprocess raw paired-end bulk RNA sequencing reads, ultimately generating a comprehensive counts file. The pipeline includes several key preprocessing steps, such as adapter trimming, genome mapping, transcript quantification, and various quality control (QC) measures to ensure high data quality.Snakemake, a Python-based tool, operates in a bash-like environment, making it particularly effective for automating repetitive tasks and streamlining complex workflows.
